develop the essay through example and illustration of the problem drawn from her and her childrens experience a well a from current event her writing illuminates sensitive issue from the perspective of someone deal directly with these problem and it doe so in frank and honest language vernesser ausley professor renee eades english 1010 16 february 2015 the challenge of an african american mother a a mother when my child be small i would always talk to them about safety i teach them never talk to or take anything from stranger never wander too far from the safety of the front yard and always look before cross the road i make sure to cover a many rule of safety with my child a possible to create awareness however a an african american mother of teen age and adult child and because of the constant fear of harassment by law enforcement of african american youth racism from peer in the public school system and the importance of maintain a positive cultural identity i be pressure to talk to my child about how to cope with racism and the internalized oppression that it cause because of the constant fear of harassment by law enforcement of african american youth i continually speak with my child about what to do or how to react if they be stop by a white police officer it no secret that young african american youth be more likely stop profile and sometimes murder by white police officer than any other race of people ive always respect and regard law enforcement to be noble men and protector of the community but a an african american especially an african american mother i question the integrity of white police officer with a great dilemma ive witness via social medium news broadcast internet and cell phone record many unarmed african american youth with their hand lift in the air pose no threat of endangerment to the white police officer who shoot them down like animal and murder them with no repercussion or indictment from the law a a mother concern for the safety and protection of my child i dont trust that the law provide protection without discrimination to child of color and to the community of our youth a they do the community of their white counterpart because most school personnel be not typically train to be culturally sensitive to the complex need of african american student often african american student be misunderstand unfairly treat and give harsh discipline than other student talk to my child about how to deal with racism from school administrator and some of their white peer in public school be a prevalent conversation among others that i discus with my child there be time when my child have come home from school very distraught because of disciplinary measure take with them by school personnel that seem to be more reflective of their race than their character seventyone percent of all suspend minority student be suspend for nonviolent offense and thing such a breaking school police for instance my daughter attend her first year of high school at lebanon high school in wilson county tennessee the first couple of week she come home from school in tear every day my daughter have always be a respectful outstanding student who have never be in trouble before she wa give i in school suspension for break the school dress code for wear a skirt a little above her knee with stretch pant a white teacher standing in the hallway while she wa change class write her up for break dress code policy my daughter make sure she wa conscious of what she wear from then on however she wa aware of the same teacher allow several white student to break the same dress code or bad sometimes she notice that some white student dress in a very provocative way with very short skirt and scantily clad spaghetti strap top which wa clearly against the school dress code policy and walk pa that same teacher every day without any disciplinary action be make my daughter clearly felt a sense of bias come from that teacher after witness this situation go on for week she and a couple of her african american friend who have similar experience deliberately break the dress code to see what would happen they all receive writeups from that teacher and receive i racism can cause african american child to become internally suppress of all the disparity in the african american community discrimination ha cause far more complex issue therefore i feel the need to teach my child the importance of maintain a positive cultural identity help them to understand their root will help them to be proud of who they be slavery wa an evil enforce upon african american that strip them of their identity and the family structure that they be so familiar with be force to survive in a new world so unfamiliar diminish to believe they be inferior and treat with le regard than animal the african american culture ha suffer a brutality that ha cause disaster to the structural foundation of family and value in conclusion a an african american mother concern for the safety and wellbeing of my child it important to me to talk with my child and help them deal with racism whether from law enforcement peer or administration in public school i also teach them the importance of a positive cultural identity since they all be factor that have affect the life of my child a well a the life of many other african american child hanna

the affected tonsil out but there wa still one tonsil in his throat that need to be remove after his throat collapse the doctor medically paralyze daddy to get the muscle to relax in order to intubate him however they would not take the risk of get the one tonsil he have leave the next step of action wa chemotherapy and radiation during the treatment i witness my father lose hair weight muscle mass strength and himself for three month daddy wa chairridden he could not lay back in a bed because there wa too much pressure on his throat therefore he have to sit up in his recliner he live in that chair besides the trip to and from the doctor because of the intensity of the chemo and radiation treatment daddy could not eat through his throat he have to get a feeding tube put in his stomach that make the food go directly into the stomach the only thing that could go in this feeding tube wa a liquid substance my mom my sister and i all take turn put the substance in his feeding tube eight time a day however during the time when we be at school or work daddy have to do it he would say he do fill his feed tube but he do not which make him lose one hundred pound after they put the feeding tube in his stomach they put a power port in his chest he receive his chemotherapy treatment through this port within the same doctor visit two life impact procedure have occur throughout the treatment daddy wa in extreme pain the pain wa cause by the cancer itself but mostly from the radiation the raw skin that wa around his neck burn because of the pain daddy take several amount of pain medication

These are the two of the three basic elements that one learns about the natural environment of any area. In this chapter you will learn about the third, that is, the atmospheric conditions that prevail over our country. Why do we wear woollens in December or why it is hot and uncomfortable in the month of May, and why it rains in June - July? The answers to all these questions can be found out by studying about the climate of India. Climate refers to the sum total of weather conditions and variations over a large area for a long period of time (more than thirty years). Weather refers to the state of the atmosphere over an area at any point of time. The elements of weather and climate are the same, i.e. temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind, humidity and precipitation. You may have observed that the weather conditions fluctuate very often even within a day. But there is some common pattern over a few weeks or months, i.e. days are cool or hot, windy or calm, cloudy or bright, and wet or dry. On the basis of the generalised monthly atmospheric conditions, the year is divided into seasons such as winter, summer or rainy seasons. The world is divided into a number of climatic regions. Do you know what type of climate India has and why it is so? We will learn about it in this chapter.  The word monsoon is derived from the Arabic word mausim which literally means season.  Monsoon refers to the seasonal reversal in the wind direction during a year. CLIMATE The climate of India is described as the monsoon type. In Asia, this type of climate is found mainly in the south and the southeast. Despite an overall unity in the general pattern, there are perceptible regional variations in climatic conditions within the country. Let us take two important elements  temperature and precipitation, and examine how they vary from place to place and season to season. In summer, the mercury occasionally touches 50°C in some parts of the Rajasthan desert, whereas it may be around 20°C in Pahalgam in Jammu and Kashmir. On a winter night, temperature at Drass in Jammu and Kashmir may be as low as minus 45°C. Thiruvananthapuram, on the other hand, may have a temperature of 22°C. In certain places there is a wide difference between day and night temperatures. In the Thar Desert the day temperature may rise to 50°C, and drop down to near 15°C the same night. On the other hand, there is hardly any difference in day and night temperatures in the Andaman and Nicobar islands or in Kerala. Let us now look at precipitation. There are variations not only in the form and types of precipitation but also in its amount and the seasonal distribution. While precipitation is mostly in the form of snowfall in the upper parts of Himalayas, it rains over the rest of the country. The annual precipitation varies from over 400 cm in Meghalaya to less than 10 cm in Ladakh and western Rajasthan. Most parts of the country receive rainfall from June to September. But some parts like the Tamil Nadu 4 Rationalised 2023-24 CLIMATE 27 Why most of the worlds deserts are located in the western margins of continents in the subtropics? Finally, relief too plays a major role in determining the climate of a place. High mountains act as barriers for cold or hot winds; they may also cause precipitation if they are high enough and lie in the path of rain-bearing winds. The leeward side of mountains remains relatively dry. FACTORS AFFECTING INDIAS CLIMATE Latitude The Tropic of Cancer passes through the middle of the country from the Rann of Kuchchh in the west to Mizoram in the east. Almost half of the country, lying south of the Tropic of Cancer, belongs to the tropical area. All the remaining area, north of the Tropic, lies in the sub-tropics. Therefore, Indias climate has characteristics of tropical as well as subtropical climates. Altitude India has mountains to the north, which have an average height of about 6,000 metres. India also has a vast coastal area where the maximum elevation is about 30 metres. The Himalayas prevent the cold winds from Central Asia from entering the subcontinent. It is because of these mountains that this subcontinent experiences comparatively milder winters as compared to central Asia. Pressure and Winds The climate and associated weather conditions in India are governed by the following atmospheric conditions:  Pressure and surface winds;  Upper air circulation; and  Western cyclonic disturbances and tropical cyclones. India lies in the region of north easterly winds. These winds originate from the subtropical high-pressure belt of the northern coast gets a large portion of its rain during October and November. In general, coastal areas experience less contrasts in temperature conditions. Seasonal contrasts are more in the interior of the country. There is decrease in rainfall generally from east to west in the Northern Plains. These variations have given rise to variety in lives of people  in terms of the food they eat, the clothes they wear and also the kind of houses they live in.  Why the houses in Rajasthan have thick walls and flat roofs?  Why is it that the houses in the Tarai region and in Goa and Mangalore have sloping roofs?  Why houses in Assam are built on stilts? CLIMATIC CONTROLS There are six major controls of the climate of any place. They are: latitude, altitude, pressure and wind system, distance from the sea (continentality), ocean currents and relief features. Due to the curvature of the earth, the amount of solar energy received varies according to latitude. As a result, air temperature generally decreases from the equator towards the poles. As one goes from the surface of the earth to higher altitudes, the atmosphere becomes less dense and temperature decreases. The hills are therefore cooler during summers. The pressure and wind system of any area depend on the latitude and altitude of the place. Thus it influences the temperature and rainfall pattern. The sea exerts a moderating influence on climate: As the distance from the sea increases, its moderating influence decreases and the people experience extreme weather conditions. This condition is known as continentality (i.e. very hot during summers and very cold during winters). Ocean currents along with onshore winds affect the climate of the coastal areas, For example, any coastal area with warm or cold currents flowing past it, will be warmed or cooled if the winds are onshore. Rationalised 2023-24 28 CONTEMPORARY INDIA-I hemisphere. They blow southwards, get deflected to the right due to the Coriolis force, and move towards the equatorial low-pressure area. Generally, these winds carry little moisture as they originate and blow over land. Therefore, they bring little or no rain. Hence, India should have been an arid land, but it is not so. Let us see why? Coriolis force: An apparent force caused by the earths rotation. The Coriolis force is responsible for deflecting winds towards the right in the northern hemisphere and towards the left in the southern hemisphere. This is also known as Ferrels Law. The pressure and wind conditions over India are unique. During winter, there is a high-pressure area north of the Himalayas. Cold dry winds blow from this region to the low-pressure areas over the oceans to the south. In summer, a low-pressure area develops over interior Asia, as well as, over northwestern India. This causes a complete reversal of the direction of winds during summer. Air moves from the high-pressure area over the southern Indian Ocean, in a south-easterly direction, crosses the equator, and turns right towards the low-pressure areas over the Indian subcontinent. These are known as the Southwest Monsoon winds. These winds blow over the warm oceans, gather moisture and bring widespread rainfall over the mainland of India.

It has moved forward displaying remarkable progress in the field of agriculture, industry, technology and overall economic development. India has also contributed significantly to the making of world history. LOCATION India is a vast country. Lying entirely in the Northern hemisphere (Figure 1.1) the main land extends between latitudes 8°4'N and 37°6'N and longitudes 68°7'E and 97°25'E.

From Figure 1.2 it is clear that India is the seventh largest country of the world. India has a land boundary of about 15,200 km and the total length of the coastline of the mainland, including Andaman and Nicobar and Lakshadweep, is 7,516.6 km. India is bounded by the young fold mountains in the northwest, north and northeast. South of about 22° north latitude, it begins to taper, and extends towards the Indian Ocean, dividing it into two seas, the Arabian Sea on the west and the Bay of Bengal on its east. Look at Figure 1.3 and note that the latitudinal and longitudinal extent of the mainland is about 30°. Despite this fact, the east-west extent appears to be smaller than the north-south extent. From Gujarat to Arunachal Pradesh, there is a time lag of two hours. Hence, time along the Standard Meridian of India (82°30'E) passing through Mirzapur (in Uttar Pradesh) is taken as the standard time for the whole country. The latitudinal extent influences the duration of day and night, as one moves from south to north.  Why 82°30'E has been selected as the Standard Meridian of India?  Why is the difference between the durations of day and night hardly felt at Kanniyakumari but not so in Kashmir? INDIA AND THE WORLD The Indian landmass has a central location between the East and the West Asia. India is a southward extension of the Asian continent. The trans Indian Ocean routes, which connect the countries of Europe in the West and the countries of East Asia, provide a strategic central location to India. Note that the Deccan Peninsula protrudes into the Indian Ocean, thus helping India to establish close contact with West Asia, Africa and Europe from the western coast and with Southeast and East Asia from the eastern coast. No other country has a long coastline on the Indian Ocean as India has and indeed, it is Indias eminent position in the Indian Ocean, which justifies the naming of an Ocean after it.

India shares its land boundaries with Pakistan and Afghanistan in the northwest, China (Tibet), Nepal and Bhutan in the north and Myanmar and Bangladesh in the east. Our southern neighbours across the sea consist of the two island countries, namely Indias contacts with the World have continued through ages but her relationships through the land routes are much older than her maritime contacts. The various passes across the mountains in the north have provided passages to the ancient travellers, while the oceans restricted such interaction for a long time. These routes have contributed in the exchange of ideas and commodities since ancient times. The ideas of the Upanishads and the Ramayana, the stories of Panchtantra, the Indian numerals and the decimal system thus could reach many parts of the world. The spices, muslin and other merchandise were taken from India to different countries. On the other hand, the influence of Greek sculpture, and the architectural styles of dome and minarets from West Asia can be seen in different parts of our country.Indias Population Size and Distribution by Numbers Indias population as on March 2011 stood at 1,210.6 million, which account for 17.5 per cent of the worlds population. These 1.21 billion people are unevenly distributed over our countrys vast area of 3.28 million square km, which accounts for 2.4 per cent of the worlds area (Figure 6.1). The 2011 Census data reveal that Uttar Pradesh with a population size of 199 million is the most populous state of India. Uttar Pradesh accounts for about 16 per cent of the countrys population. On the other hand, the Himalayan state of Sikkim has a population of just about 0.6 million and Lakshadweep has only 64,429 people. Almost half of Indias population lives in just five states. These are Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh. Rajasthan, the biggest state in terms of area, has only 5.5 per cent of the total population of India (Figure 6.2)  What could be the reason of uneven distribution of population in India? Census A census is an official enumeration of population done periodically. In India, the first census was held in the year 1872. The first complete census, however, was taken in the year 1881. Since then, censuses have been held regularly every tenth year. The Indian Census is the most comprehensive source of demographic, social and economic data. Have you ever seen a census report? Check in your library if it has one. 6 Rationalised 2023-24 POPULATION 49 Indias Population Distribution by Density Population density provides a better picture of the uneven distribution. Population density is calculated as the number of persons per unit area. India is one of the most densely populated countries of the world.

Find out the population densities of Bangladesh and Japan. The population density of India in the year 2011 was 382 persons per sq km. Densities vary from 1,102 persons per sq km in Bihar to only 17 persons per sq km in Arunachal Pradesh. A study of the Figure 6.3 shows the pattern of uneven distribution of population densities at the State level.

Fig. 6.3: Density of Population (Census of India 2011) Rationalised 2023-24 POPULATION 51 2 per cent per annum means that in a given year, there was an increase of two persons for every 100 persons in the base population. This is referred to as the annual growth rate. Indias population has been steadily increasing from 361 million in 1951 to 1210 million in 2011. Table 6.1 : The Magnitude and Rate of Indias Population Growth Year Total Absolute Annual Population Increase in Growth (in million) the Decade Rate (in million) ( % ) 1951 361.0 42.43 1.25 1961 439.2 78.15 1.96 1971 548.2 108.92 2.20 1981 683.3 135.17 2.22 1991 846.4 163.09 2.16 2001 1028.7 182.32 1.97 2011 1210.6 181.46 1.64 Table 6.1 and Figures 6.4 (a) and 6.4 (b) reveal that from 1951 to 1981, the annual rate of population growth was steadily increasing; which explains the rapid increase in population from 361 million in 1951 to 683 million in 1981.  Table 6.1 reveals that despite the decline in growth rates, the number of people being added every decade is steadily increasing. Why? Since 1981, however, the rate of growth started declining gradually. During this period, birth rates declined rapidly. Still 182 million people were added to the total population in the 1990s alone (an annual addition larger than ever before). It is essential to realise that India has a very large population. When a low annual rate is applied to a very large population, it yields a large absolute increase. When more than a billion people increase even at a lower rate, the total number being added becomes very large. Indias annual increase in population is large enough to neutralise efforts to conserve the resource endowment and environment. The declining trend of the growth rate is indeed a positive indicator of the efforts of birth control. Despite that, the total additions to the population base continue to grow, and India Activity ActivityActivity Study the Figure 6.3 and compare it with Figure 2.4 and Figure 4.7. Do you find any corelation between these maps? Note the States with population densities below 250 persons per square km. Rugged terrain and unfavourable climatic conditions are primarily responsible for sparse population in these areas. Which states have density below 250 persons per square km? Assam and most of the Peninsular states have moderate population densities. Hilly, dissected and rocky nature of the terrain, Everything available in our environment which can be used to satisfy our needs, provided, it is technologically accessible, economically feasible and culturally acceptable can be termed as Resource. The process of transformation of things available in our environment involves an interactive relationship between nature, technology and institutions. Human beings interact with nature through technology and create institutions to accelerate their economic development. Do you think that resources are free gifts of nature as is assumed by many? They are not. Resources are a function of human activities. Human beings themselves are essential components of resources. They transform material available in our environment into resources and use them. These resources can be classified in the following ways  (a) On the basis of origin  biotic and abiotic (b) On the basis of exhaustibility  renewable and non-renewable (c) On the basis of ownership  individual, community, national and international (d) On the basis of status of development  potential, developed stock and reserves.

Fig. 1.1: Interdependent relationship between nature, technology and institutions Fig. 1.2: Classification of resources Rationalised-2023-24 2 CONTEMPORARY INDIA  II DEVELOPMENT OF RESOURCES Resources are vital for human survival as well as for maintaining the quality of life. It was believed that resources are free gifts of nature. As a result, human beings used them indiscriminately and this has led to the following major problems.  Depletion of resources for satisfying the greed of a few individuals.  Accumulation of resources in few hands, which, in turn, divided the society into two segments i.e. haves and have nots or rich and poor.  Indiscriminate exploitation of resources has led to global ecological crises such as, global warming, ozone layer depletion, environmental pollution and land degradation. An equitable distribution of resources has become essential for a sustained quality of life and global peace. If the present trend of resource depletion by a few individuals and countries continues, the future of our planet is in danger. Therefore, resource planning is essential for sustainable existence of all forms of life. Sustainable existence is a component of sustainable development. Sustainable development Sustainable economic development means development should take place without damaging the environment, and development in the present should not compromise with the needs of the future generations. Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, 1992 In June 1992, more than 100 heads of states met in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, for the first International Earth Summit. The Summit was convened for addressing urgent problems of environmental protection and socio economic development at the global level. The assembled leaders signed the Declaration on Global Climatic Change and Biological Diversity. The Rio Convention endorsed the global Forest Principles and adopted Agenda 21 for achieving Sustainable Development in the 21st century. Agenda 21 It is the declaration signed by world leaders in 1992 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), which took place at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It aims at achieving global sustainable development. It is an agenda to combat environmental damage, poverty, disease through global co-operation on common interests, mutual needs and shared responsibilities. One major objective of the Agenda 21 is that every local government should draw its own local Agenda 21. Prepare a list of stock and reserve, resources that you are familiar with from your local area. 1. Imagine, if the oil supply gets exhausted one day, how would this affect our life style? 2. Plan a survey in your colony/village to investigate peoples attitude towards recycling of the domestic/agricultural wastes. Ask questions about : (a) What do they think about resources they use? (b) What is their opinion about the wastes, and its utilisation? (c) Collage your results. RESOURCE PLANNING Planning is the widely accepted strategy for judicious use of resources. It has importance in a country like India, which has enormous diversity in the availability of resources. There are regions which are rich in certain types of resources but are deficient in some other Rationalised-2023-24 RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT 3 resources. There are some regions which can be considered self sufficient in terms of the availability of resources and there are some regions which have acute shortage of some vital resources. For example, the states of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh are rich in minerals and coal deposits. Arunachal Pradesh has abundance of water resources but lacks in infrastructural development. The state of Rajasthan is very well endowed with solar and wind energy but lacks in water resources. The cold desert of Ladakh is relatively isolated from the rest of the country. It has very rich cultural heritage but it is deficient in water, infrastructure and some vital minerals. This calls for balanced resource planning at the national, state, regional and local levels..This is the most widely spread and important

made of alluvial soil. These have been
deposited by three important Himalayan river
systems  the Indus, the Ganga and the

Alluvial soils as a whole are very fertile.
Mostly these soils contain adequate proportion
of potash, phosphoric acid and lime which
are ideal for the growth of sugarcane, paddy,
wheat and other cereal and pulse crops. Due
to its high fertility, regions of alluvial soils are
intensively cultivated and densely populated.
Soils in the drier areas are more alkaline and
can be productive after proper treatment and
irrigation.
Black Soil
These soils are black in colour and are also
known as regur soils. Black soil is ideal for
growing cotton and is also known as black
cotton soil. It is believed that climatic condition
along with the parent rock material are the
important factors for the formation of black
soil. This type of soil is typical of the Deccan
trap (Basalt) region spread over northwest
Deccan plateau and is made up of lava flows.
They cover the plateaus of Maharashtra,

In our opinion and to the best of our infonnation and according to the explanations given to us, the Statement: 1. is presented in accordance with the requirements of the Listing Regulations in this regard; and ii. gives a true and fair view in confonnity with the applicable accounting standards and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the net profit and other comprehensive loss and other financial infonnation of the Corporation for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 and for the year ended March 31, 2023. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (""SAs"") specified under Section 143( 10) of the Companies Act, 2013, as amended (the ""Act""). Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the ""Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Results"" section of our report. We are independent of the Corporation in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Management's and Board of Directors' Responsibilities for the Standalone Financial Results Page 1 of3 S. accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Corporation and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Statement that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the Statement, the Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for assessing the Corporation's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Management and the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Corporation or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Management and the Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Corporation's financial reporting process. Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Results Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Statement as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the Statement. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Statement, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Corporation has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls;  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors;  Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Corporation's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial results or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Corporation to cease to continue as a going concern; and  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Statement, including the disclosures, and whether the Statement represents the u erlying transactions and events in a ~Q\ & Co manner that achieves fair presentation. f.J>;.PAD4 J~""~);-~ r .....

Besides, most of the credit checks and scores used by your Bank in process- based underwriting are replicated for digital loans.

The risk measures include position limits, tenor restrictions, sensitivity limits, namely, PV01, Modified Duration of Hold to Maturity Portfolio and Option Greeks, Valueat-Risk (VaR) Limit, Stop Loss Trigger Level (SLTL), Scenario based P&L Triggers, Potential Loss Trigger Level (PLTL), and are monitored on an end-of-day basis. In addition, forex open positions, currency option delta and interest rate sensitivity limits are computed and monitored on an intraday basis. This is supplemented by a Board-approved stress testing policy and framework that simulates various market risk scenarios to measure losses and initiate remedial measures. The Market Risk capital charge of your Bank is computed on a daily basis using the Standardised Measurement Method applying the HDFC Bank House, Senapati Bapat Marg, Lower Parel (W), Mumbai 400 013.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION
Informal Negotiations
To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms of Service (each a Dispute and collectively, the Disputes) brought by either you or us (individually, a Party and collectively, the Parties), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least three (3) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.

Binding Arbitration
If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN
COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) and, where appropriate, the AAAs Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator
 
compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in [	County,	]. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in [	County,	], and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms of Use.

In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site be commenced more than two (2) years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

Restrictions
The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration

The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

hospital salford manchester m6 8hd uk the purpose of this article be to summarise how functional imaging technique have change our understanding of normal and abnormal pain mechanism how they inform a change in clinical practice and to speculate on possible future clinical u the experience of pain can only be define in term of human consciousness functional imaging technique have make it possible to identify the main cerebral component of the human nociceptive system these comprise at least two main human nociceptive system work in parallel call the medial and lateral pain system fig 1 this ha provide a physical construct for the concept of the human pain matrix1 we be just begin to understand the division of function within these system provide the possibility of establish a more rational framework for pain therapy there be a spectrum of pain experience from pain that may closely reflect physical event in tissue eg lead to excitation of nociceptors nociceptive pain to pain that be generate without any peripheral physical input eg psychogenic and neuropathic pain the brain be therefore act a a virtual reality system that may or may not be constrain by interaction with the body internal and external environment in order to understand these interaction noninvasive method for measure cerebral response in man be require functional imaging technique provide the mean to understand some of the molecular event underpin these interaction which have be recently reviewed25 the purpose of this article be to summarise how functional imaging technique have change our understanding of normal and abnormal pain mechanism how they inform a change in clinical practice and to speculate on possible future clinical u no new major class of analgesic have be develop in the last century apart from the extended role of tricyclic antidepressant a adjunct analgesic and 5ht1a agonist for migraine there be many reason for this but one may have be the difficulty in translate animal model of pain to adequate proofofconcept trial in human british medical bulletin 2003 65 8393 the british council 2003 doi 101093bmbldg65083 the other problem relate to the assumption that modulation of nociceptive processing at any level may alter pain experience this particularly apply to pharmacological agent which may have very different effect at different site within the nervous system a classic example be capsaicin which be strongly algesic at the periphery and dorsal horn of the spinal cord but analgesic when inject intracerebroventricularly functional imaging provide the mean to measure integrated nociceptive processing in the brain to define pathophysiological mechanism of some of the main clinical pain state and to define potential therapeutic target some of these technique have already provide welldefined target for new class of analgesic although there be no established role for functional imaging in pain management there may be a great role for functional imaging in patient assessment analgesic development and response monitoring scope and limitation of functional imaging for the study of pain electrophysiological technique painevoked potential eeg frequency analysis and meg pet and fmri provide access to nociceptive processing mainly within the brain however recent study have extend some of these approach to the spinal cord6 only 18ffluorodeoxyglucose 18ffdg pet and electrophysiological technique provide direct measurement of neuronal activity and therefore currently provide the most robust measure of drug modulation of nociceptive activity electrophysiological technique with their millisecond temporal resolution provide the mean to study early attentional and anticipatory component of nociceptive processing improve technique for source localisation of painevoked potential have provide greatly improve spatial resolution with millimetre reproducibility7 improve technique for meg analysis sam analysis provide a spmlike approach to complex data sets8 pet ha provide the mean to measure both metabolic and neurochemical aspect of nociceptive processing this ha allow the identification of receptor system and change in their occupation during acute and chronic pain911 in addition to image aspect of cholinergic6 and dopaminergic transmission12 the great advantage of fmri over pet be that it be possible to make repeated measure of nociceptive response without the constraint impose by the use of radioactivity allow much more complex experimental design the weakness of all these technique be that in the final analysis we be leave with significant blob on brain volume without directional information and without information about the ascending or descend nociceptive input from which they result they can therefore only be interpret with reference to detail anatomical and pharmacological study derive from animal1316 and human post mortem17 study this together with information from evoke potential and meg can begin to provide a working model of the circuitry concern with nociceptive processing this approach ha provide some significant insight into human pain perception that would not have be possible from extrapolation from study in animal in isolation the combine use of different technique such a opiate receptor image with functional study ha already provide some important insight into the integration of different neurochemically defined system within the brain18 electrophysiological technique have provide some information on the temporal sequence of nociceptive processing within the pain matrix and improve technique will provide the great detail require for a dynamic model of nociceptive processing19 the most important feature of functional brain imaging technique be that they be able to measure many aspect of nociceptive processing such a anticipation of pain and neurochemical change associate with pain which can not be measure by any other mean acute and chronic nociceptive processing in the human pain matrix there be a general consensus on the main component of the human pain matrix fig 120 it ha be assume for many year that the medial and lateral system might respectively be concern with processing chronic and acute pain21 functional imaging study have provide unequivocal evidence that this be not the case both system be involve in acute nociceptive processing and at least one type neuropathic of chronic pain and these be process in parallel4 it ha be traditional to think of acute and chronic pain a be very distinct process possibly with certain type of chronic pain be process within discreet brain region at a clinical level many type of chronic pain such a arthritic pain be a mixture of recurrent acute pain and chronic ongoing pain it be difficult to see an empirical advantage of process each type of pain in a separate and discrete nociceptive system so far there be very little evidence from image study for a division of function within the pain matrix on the basis of the temporal component of pain422 however there may be some more subtle difference between acute and chronic pain process component of the lateral system such a the primary somatosensory si cortex do appear to be a frequently activate with tonic nonphasic experimental pain and phasic pain 67 and 69 of study show activation respectively but only 23 fig 1 schematic diagram of some of the main anatomical component of the pain matrix and their possible functional significance pag periaqueductal grey matter of study of chronic ongoing clinical pain demonstrate activation of si there be a number of potential reason for this nociceptive projection to si be sparse23 also this be the only area where functional imaging experiment have demonstrate any convincing somatotopy for pain24 therefore summation of response to chronic pain in different location may dilute the signal change in si response within the medial system appear to be predominantly bilateral and nonsomatotopic42526 acute pain experiment tend to stimulate the same or adjacent location whereas chronic pain experiment often include patient with variable pain location and therefore may spatially dilute an already weak signal in si however it may be that signal in si and other component of the lateral system be faster and more shortlived a further reason to distinguish between acute and chronic pain be the clear timedependent neurochemical change that occur for instance in the spinal cord in various subacute pain models27 this ha lead to the general belief that there must be important pharmacotherapeutic difference between acute and chronic pain however so far there be no evidence for any class of analgesic only be effective in the acute or chronic phase of any type of pain such difference may exist but they have yet to be clearly demonstrate in man what factor affect the pattern of nociceptive processing in the brain in term of response to experimental pain it be now very clear that the psychological context of the stimulus in term of anticipation and attention be a important a the stimulus parameter it have be previously think that anticipation might only activate certain component of the medial system such a medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex and that these area be adjacent and discrete from those activate by pain28 subsequent study however suggest that these response could be block by benzodiazepine and therefore may be more related to anxiety than anticipation of pain per se more recently it ha be show that most of the nociceptive system can be activate by anticipation of a painful stimulus29 the anticipatory response be just small than the pain intensityrelated response far evidence for the importance of topdown effect come from a number of study show the effect of altered attention on nociceptive processing3031 alter cingulate response during different attentional instruction have be interpret in the context of difference be cop strategies32 these study provide clear evidence for topdown influence on nociceptive processing they also help the interpretation of early clinical study where substantial difference in response to thermal pain stimulus be observe in patient with different type of clinical pain response to standardise acute thermal pain stimulus be reduce in patient with acute postdental extraction inflammatory pain and ongoing chronic arthritic pain compare to controls3334 patient with chronic psychogenicallymaintained pain atypical facial pain demonstrate enhanced response to acute thermal stimulation compare to controls35 in the anterior cingulate cortex the enhanced response be think to represent abnormal attention to the affective processing of nociceptive input that might contribute to the perseverance of chronic pain in these individual the observation that attention can profoundly affect the pattern of nociceptive response within the pain matrix give some credence to this concept36 however more recent study in patient with low back pain and depression do not demonstrate significant difference in nociceptive processing between this group and painfree controls55 endogenous modulation system and division of function within the pain matrix there be still relatively few study of endogenous pharmacological modulation of human nociception pet study have demonstrate change in opioid receptor binding in chronic neuropathic and inflammatory arthritic pain1011 in addition to acute experimental pain9 these be consistent with increased occupation of opioid receptor during pain these change be predominantly within the medial system there be increase evidence that the main division of function within the pain matrix be that the lateral system be more concerned with the sensory discriminative component such a localisation and texture437 whereas the medial system be more concerned with the affective and motivational component of nociception this be consistent with the neurosurgical observation that deafferentation of the anterior cingulate cortex in patient with chronic intractable pain produce a state where they still experience pain but it no longer bother them38 this result be quite similar to the clinical observation of the effect of synthetic opiate which be rarely painablative but substantially reduce the unpleasantness of acute and chronic pain interestingly the high concentration of opioid receptor be find in component of the medial pain system such a the perigenual underneath the anterior protrusion of the corpus callosum cingulate cortex and medial thalamus whereas some of the cortical projection of the primary somatosensory cortex can be identify by their low opioid receptor binding3940 preliminary observation in chronic pain suggest that synthetic opiate appear mainly to alter function within the projection of the medial system41 most of the change that occur in opioid receptor binding in both acute and chronic pain be within the medial system recent observation suggest that placebo analgesia be at least partially mediate by endogenous opioid peptides42 and that opiate and placebomediated analgesia share common circuitry in the anterior cingulate cortex43 there be therefore increase evidence for the role of the medial pain system in particular the anterior cingulate cortex in the control of attention to the affective and motivational component of acute and chronic pain synthetic and endogenous opiate probably both modulate cingulate nociceptive activity44 their cerebral mechanism of action be still uncertain but anatomical study suggest mu opioid modulation of thalamocortical loop project through anterior cingulate cortex45 the modulation of the breakdown of endogenous opioid peptide ha be identify a a potential therapeutic target by a number of pharmaceutical companies46 pattern of neural activity in different type of clinical pain syndrome pharmacological mechanism have be demonstrate in the dorsal horn in association with neuropathic and inflammatory pain models27 that may contribute to some form of allodynia pain induce by sensory modality such a touch that would not normally induce pain however in term of what signal the brain see these spinal mechanism convert what would normally be signal in nonnociceptive ascend pathway to signal within the ascend nociceptive channel ascend spinothalamic tract so far there be no evidence in human that such pain be process within different brain structure when induce experimentally acutely capsaicin induced allodynia47 or when study in patient with chronic neuropathic pain4849 however there be a trend of reduced activity within the thalamus during the ongoing neuropathic pain485051 formal comparison with other type of pain have not be make but it be possible that this may represent reduced activity of inhibitory interneurones within the thalamus recently the response to allodynia to pressure in patient with chronic widespread pain fibromyalgia ha be compare to response to similar level of pressure induce pain in painfree volunteer and find to produce the same pattern of activity within the major component of the pain matrix52 in general for most type of pain there do not appear to be specific brain area dedicate to specific type of pain however interesting preliminary study in headache may provide a possible exception to this generalisation in that there seem to be more prominent subcortical activation than cortical activation pet study during headache have measure increased activity in the midbrain and pons in migraine and the hypothalamus during cluster headache these observation take together with what be know about the mechanism of these type of headache may provide evidence for a neurovascular aetiology rather than a primary vascular mechanism53 however it should be mention that all these area be activate in other type of pain therefore if there be a specific pattern to these response it be likely to be relate to the predominance of a subcortical pattern of activity rather than the specific structure involve it be too early to say whether it be possible to distinguish between different category nociceptive neuropathic or psychogenic or even imagine of pain use functional imaging however different pattern of response within the pain matrix be measurable in different pain syndrome and in different psychological context more sophisticated method for measure different aspect of simultaneous processing within the pain matrix be emerging54 it be possible that some of these may be use to categorise clinical pain syndrome match them to appropriate treatment and monitor response to such treatment in the future this may particularly apply a the development and therapeutic cost of new treatment escalate drug development functional imaging technique have provide the mean to identify component of the pain matrix and their specific function careful study of these area of the human brain ha the potential to yield new class of analgesic compound the use of functional imaging at a proofofconcept stage of drug development ha the potential for greatly reduce the cost of clinical development pet provide the mean to measure tissue concentration of labelled drug in brain and other tissue and also to measure change in receptor occupancy it be encourage that there be now substantial investment in this area of research by the pharmaceutical industry physiological basis for the subclassification of pain the international association for the study of pain iasp ha provide a classification of pain that include 32 main group of pain each with subclassifications much of the classification relate to the place and system that the pain occur in and it temporal characteristic this ha provide an invaluable basis for epidemiological study and healthcare planning however in term of nociceptive process the temporal and spatial feature of pain may be of le importance this particularly apply to localisation a most nociceptive processing within the medial system be nonsomatotopic there be no identifiable system dedicate to process pain of a particular type location or duration and yet these assumption provide a common framework for the organisation of pain service pain trial and the teaching of medical student it may be more helpful to consider why certain type of pain such a neuropathic and psychogenicallymaintained pain somotoform pain disorder be more likely to become chronic than try to make distinction between acute and chronic pain that so far have no biological basis in man the current practice of do separate trial in acute and chronic pain may also be question on the same basis conclusion the brain doe not share the construct for pain perception and treatment that the medical profession would like to impose on it it be premature to reclassify pain on a physiological basis when this doe occur it be likely to be simpler with le emphasis on localisation and duration with great emphasis on the psychological context of the pain and the pathophysiological mechanism result in

be one limit factor in the development of simulated agent represent adversary and teammate in military and game simulation several researcher have address this problem with vary degree of success the problem mostly lie in the fact that tactical knowledge be difficult to elicit and represent through interactive session between the model developer and the subject matter expert this paper describe a novel approach that employ genetic programming in conjunction with contextbased reason to evolve tactical agent base upon automatic observation of a human perform a mission on a simulator in this paper we describe the process use to carry out the learn a prototype wa build to demonstrate feasibility and it be describe herein the prototype wa rigorously and extensively test the evolved agent exhibit good fidelity to the observed human performance a well a the capacity to generalize from it index termscontextbased reason human behavioral modeling genetic programming simulation i background and problem definition w e believe that the most significant obstacle in the development of tactical agent ha be the inability of developer to quickly and effectively build robust agent upon demand we define tactical agent a computer model of human that deal with their environment in a way similar to how a human would if face the same situation while in the execution of a mission these agent demonstrate tactical behavior which we further define a the continuous and dynamic process of decision making by a tactical agent human or otherwise who interact with it environment while attempt to carry out a mission in the environment the high level of complexity of many of the exist agent architecture make the task of build these tactical agent very difficultweassertthatthisdifficultyandits
